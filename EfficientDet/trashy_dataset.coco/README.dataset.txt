This computer vision project focuses on detecting and classifying trash bags into four categories:

* **Mixed Waste (Black Bag)**
* **Organic Waste (White Bag)**
* **Recycled Waste (Grey or Green Bag)**
* **Other**

The goal is to create a labeled dataset with bounding boxes around trash bags to train a machine learning model for waste sorting applications. The dataset is structured to support efficient and accurate identification of trash bag types, aiding automation in waste management processes.

This project contributes to environmental sustainability by enabling smarter waste segregation using AI.


This project is the final project for the Study Unit **ARI3129: Advanced Computer Vision for Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Malta Year 3 Sem 1**.
